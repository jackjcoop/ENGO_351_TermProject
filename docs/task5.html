	    <p class="center"> Through all of our research and analysis of different maps, we have came to many conclusions. </p>
	    <br> </br>
	   <p> A significant portion of the population along the eastern coastline of the United States has a high probability of experiencing a hurricane at some point. The density and intensity increases as you move southward, this is mainly due to the increased sea temperatures as you approach the equator. The cities that lie within the Gulf of Mexico are impacted less frequently as those that lie upon the outer coast, being due to the physical barrier of the peninsulas and islands. The peninsula of Florida being one of those barriers sees a large amount of hurricane activity due to its positioning.
